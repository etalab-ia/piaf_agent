### Run with docker

A Dockerfile for running your app in production is already prepared. You only have to build the image and run it, typing :

```bash
docker build -t piafagent_image .
docker run -d -p 8081:80 --name piafagent piafagent_image
```

Note: the 8081 port will of course depend on your nginx / apache configuration.
